# 1 Objectives, List of Stakeholders and Problem Definition 

## 1.1 Objectives

The objectives of this report will be to design a prototype to develop an information system for a major travel company and define the existing problems. This report will include a design thinking approach and an Agile Scrum methodology in order to develop this prototype. Identifying the stakeholders that are possible to clarify what kind of concerns they have. And through this project purpose, it can also define what kind of relationship is desirable. In addition, it is important to collaborate with stakeholders to provide better service for this project, so this project needs to ensure stakeholder needs and project needs.
For RUP models, the early stage of this project will use Use cases to design and analyse the prototype so that the basic structure of OO software can be built. As we use a waterfall model, there is only an opportunity to define requirements when the project starts. The Requests for this project can only be heard through requirements definition and basic design. Therefore, it takes a lot of time and effort when the specifications are changed during the project or after seeing the deliverables. Due to the number of man-hours required to redo, delivery of the final deliverable will be delayed so a use case basis builds iteration of the possible risks of large functions and important functions.

Thus, the following objectives of this report will be to:

- Identify stakeholders.
- Describe your approach from a Design Thinking principles perspective.
- Explain the agile methodology, namely, Scrum we have used to carry out the procedure.
- Describe our approach to four phases of Design Thinking principles to develop the Artefacts.
- List the assumptions we have made in the systems analysis.
- Document our proposed work products and models
- Argue                  competitive advantage
- consider the possible effects for this business as this information system project fails.
## 1.2 List of Stakeholders

## 1.3 Problem Definition

The major travel company would like to develop their in-house call management center to provide the improved call routing and dynamic call flow control for customers so they can improve customer satisfaction and sales.

The company is still ....           

These problems include:


- During busy times, customers wait for a long time they may hang up. Without talking to the operator, the customer would have to call back multiple times. This causes an increase in the total number of calls, which leads to a vicious circle in which it is difficult to connect to the phone. For customers, when they finally get a call, they feel even more stressed, and this can cause a double or triple vicious cycle of affecting the motivation of the operator who handles the customer.
- The customer call relationship manager has a high turnover rate, and one of the reasons is that it is easy to feel stress due to customer service. That is difficult to develop excellent human resources. In such an environment, there is a chronic shortage of manpower. Inexperienced bands have to teach newcomers, and the frequency of newcomers is not well educated. It leads to a vicious circle in which the employees face the business with insufficient education and cannot make a satisfactory response, resulting in complaints.

## 1.4 Assumptions

1. RM inputs customer’s details (i.e name, postcode) into the existing ‘Profiler Tool’ at the beginning of their exchange.

2. ‘Profiler Tool’ determines cultural background based on the customer’s surname.

# 2 Design Thinking approach with artefacts
** improve the service, introduce a Chat Bot? **

## 2.1 Assumptions


1. The ‘10 minutes questionnaire’ determines RM’s age, sex, culture, language proficiency, previous experience and product knowledge at the initial hiring.

2. The system will automatically update age of RM and customer, while sex and language proficiency is manually inputted upon request.

3. Data for outbound call’s ‘target list’ is retrieved from previous customers within CMC as well as data from third party companies that have access to a potential customer’s online search history.

4. A potential customer’s no. is added into the ‘target list’ after searching ‘holiday packages’ which CMC has to offer.

5. Once an outbound call ends, the system will give a 15 seconds second delay before redialing the subsequent no. on the ‘target list’.

6. During busy times, an inbound call’s ‘Interactive Voice Response’ prompts options;
- “Interested in one of our holiday packages?”
    - Prompts a list of countries and cities CMC offers
- “Cancel an existing holiday package?”
- “Asking a specific query”

7. System will determine which RM to route the customer to based on their selected prompt 


## 2.2 Design Thinking 
Design thinking to this project is implementing the 5 phases to ensure that undefined business problems and user needs. The Systematic approach is able to meet customer value and market opportunity.


### 2.2.1 Phase1 Empathy:
The project team will observe how the stakeholders feel. At the empathy stage, it is necessary to see things with a fresh look. It is important to gain a better understanding of how stakeholders feel about the current process and how to perform the task. Therefore, the project team conducts one-on-one or group sessions with customers. Collaborating with customers directly involved reveals a vast amount of information about their way of thinking and values that is insight. The revealed information will be written on the wall and find the relationship of information. After the session, investigate deeper and try to discover unexpected insights.
